            What comes to our mind the moment we think of Artificial
            Intelligence? The intelligence which is not real, which is generated
            by humans, which thrives on the brains of humans. But the fact is
            that human mind is irreplaceable. No technology can stand-in for
            human brain. Still artificial intelligence is somehow reducing the
            efforts of humans and human, being a lazy animal is very rightly
            taking advantage of it. Al-powered decision-making systems are being
            used in almost every domain, ranging from healthcare to finance to
            criminal justice.However, relying completely on Al can also turn out
            to be dangerous because every technology has to face some challenges
            so does Al decision making. The first challenge in Al decision
            making is regarding bias in data and decision making of algorithm.
            The bias in Al can occur when two data sets or statistics are not
            considered equal. This can happen due to wrong presumptions in
            algorithm or possibly because of collection of biased databases.
            This can result into partial outcomes. Thus in order to ensure fair
            and unbiased outcomes for all, the addressal of this challenge is
            must.

            The first challenge in AI decision making is regarding bias in data
            and decision making of algorithm. The bias in AI can occur when two
            data sets or statistics are not considered equal. This can happen
            due to wrong presumptions in algorithm or possibly because of
            collection of biased databases. This can result into partial
            outcomes. Thus in order to ensure fair and unbiased outcomes for
            all, the addressal of this challenge is must.
            <br />
            <br />
            Lack of transparency can be the next crucial challenge in AI
            decision making. AI being a broad terminology is programmed in a way
            that it can fulfill human needs or objectives. Many such systems
            which provide desired output to users are known are “black box”
            systems where there is no clue to the users as to how did they reach
            to the desired output. It means that the internal working of such
            systems is either unknown or incomprehensible by the end users. AI
            transparency and interpretability is important concern in the domain
            of AI ethics. This is dilemma of concern and critically needs to be
            addressed.
            <br />
            <br />

            Another challenge is that of privacy. In this era where most of our
            decisions are taken by AI, we cannot neglect the privacy element.
            Personal information of users need to be handled safely and privacy
            should be given utmost priority. Hence, it is a challenge which if
            addressed can make quick decisions for the users that too keeping
            their privacy in mind.
          </p>
          <br />

          <br />
          <p>
            Safety is also a concerned matter when we talk about AI-decision
            making. There are chances of AI systems making mistakes and in such
            cases users face serious consequences. For example if AI- powered
            vehicles make any mistake in decision making then it can cause an
            accident which can turn out to be deadly. Thus it is important to
            check whether the AI systems are safe before they are used in
            significant implementation.

            <br />
            <br />

            Thus we need to make sure that these challenges are overcome in near
            future as we are more or less dependent on AI decisions. Scientists
            are working on these issues and hopefully we will be having ethical
            AI system which benefits the whole of society soon.
